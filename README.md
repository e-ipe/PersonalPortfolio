# PersonalPortfolio

Hello! Welcome to my Personal Portfolio. Below is a guide for my projects/demos.

**Dice Simulator (Arduino)** - 
I have developed a sophisticated Dice Simulator utilizing an Arduino platform. This innovative system generates randomized numerical outcomes, which are then visually represented through the illumination of LEDs. To witness this in action, please refer to the following demonstration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17y_vVaZjICC0FkQ0hzfGV7O9OFkB31Cj/view

**Digital Clock (Python)** - 
This project constitutes a Python-based mini-application strategically leveraging external libraries to streamline code length. Its primary function involves presenting a real-time digital clock display. This is a demo of the program running: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pjUAtSSbrweS6wtlt2uOSjvOt4WWN4J_/view?usp=sharing

**Flashcard Project (HTML/CSS/Javascript)** - 
In response to my friend's desire to avoid intrusive advertisements on existing language-learning platforms, I embarked on a personal project. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I crafted a comprehensive Flashcard Simulator. This solution provides a seamless and ad-free learning experience. You can explore this project through the following demonstration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CjHeLePrv360mL0t2-61oeb73h7OY8Jg/view?usp=drive_link

**OSV (Arduino)** - 
The Over Surface Vehicle (OSV) project, a collaborative endeavor involving eight engineering students, was orchestrated under my leadership. My responsibilities encompassed logistical coordination and the development of the vehicle's locomotion capabilities. For a comprehensive overview of the project, along with demonstration materials, please refer to the following documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhX33nWiqcQbecX3PvuDHr6WYWVQ1Z5Pwkas-2X24T0/edit?usp=drive_link 

**Password Generator (Python)** - 
This is a compact Python software project designed to produce a unique password upon each program execution. The generated password is a randomly composed sequence, comprising precisely 16 characters. For a comprehensive demonstration of this functionality, please refer to the following showcase: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ORXSnKVlq0zvWii-93OrCZokXDf083Vh/view?usp=sharing

**Personal Project Website (HTML/CSS)** - 
As part of my digital portfolio, I have crafted an aesthetically pleasing website using HTML and CSS. This platform serves as an elegant showcase for my various projects and provides insight into my background. To explore this personal website, kindly refer to the following demonstration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gXAJtsYVRFESXsED41J8xQKuNpoJdxO8/view?usp=drive_link

**Photo Album App (Swift)** - 
In the realm of mobile app development, I present to you a sophisticated Photo Album App, engineered with Swift. This application enables users to seamlessly view multiple images on a single page and generate random images on demand. To experience this app firsthand, please refer to the following demonstration: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wzlc_VNIvC8IjlEBslt03Wz_gev_IfN7/view?usp=drive_link
