Hello! Welcome to my Personal Portfolio. Below is a guide for my projects/demos.

**Dice Simulator (Arduino)**
I created a dice simulator that generates a random number, and then the corresponding number of LEDs light up on the arduino. Here is a demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17y_vVaZjICC0FkQ0hzfGV7O9OFkB31Cj/view?usp=drive_link

**Flashcard Project (HTML/CSS/Javascript)**
When my friend started taking French and told me she didn't want to use Quizlet (because of advertisements), I decided to take the matter into my own hands. I created my own flashcard simulator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Here is a demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CjHeLePrv360mL0t2-61oeb73h7OY8Jg/view?usp=drive_link

**OSV (Arduino)**
OSV stands for over surface vehicle. This was a group project, and I was the team leader of 8 engineering students. I was in charge of all logistics, but I was also in charge of making the vehicle move. Here is more information and demos: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhX33nWiqcQbecX3PvuDHr6WYWVQ1Z5Pwkas-2X24T0/edit?usp=drive_link 

**Personal Project Website (HTML/CSS)**
I created a website using HTML and CSS that serves as an aesthetically pleasing way to view my projects and information about me. Here is a demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gXAJtsYVRFESXsED41J8xQKuNpoJdxO8/view?usp=drive_link

**Photo Album App (Swift)**
I created a photo album app using Swift that allows you to view many different images on one page, and generate a random image on another page. Here is a demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wzlc_VNIvC8IjlEBslt03Wz_gev_IfN7/view?usp=drive_link
